<h2>The Concepts and Computation Lab</h2>

<p>
  We are an interdisciplinary lab investigating how the mind works from a computational perspective.

<p>
  As part of the <a href="https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc" target="_blank">Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation (ILCC)</a>
  at the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh,
  we are proudly located at Scotland's beautiful historical center.
