<h2>Computational Cognitive Science Lab</h2>
<p style="margin-top: -15px;font-size: large;">Led by <b>Bonan Zhao</b></p>

<p>
  As part of the <a href="https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc" target="_blank">Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation (ILCC)</a>
  at the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh,
  we are proudly located at Scotland's beautiful historical center.
</p>

<h3>Research</h3>

<p>
  We build computational models, aiming to reverse-engineer the information-processing algorithms of the human mind.
  To evaluate these models, we run (online) behavioral experiments and collect empirical data.
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
  The lab is particularly excited by topics like:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Why do people (sometimes) think about the same question differently?</li>
  <li>How do people create concepts and communicate their thoughts?</li>
  <li>How do people solve problems together?</li>
  <li>What is the role of language in thinking?</li>
  <li>What does it mean to create human-like intelligence?</li>
</ul>
